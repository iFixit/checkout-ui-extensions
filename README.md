# iFixit Checkout UI Extensions App

## Getting started

### Requirements

-  You must [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it. Use [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to make managing your node version easier.

#### Local Development

Install dependencies with the following command. Make sure your node and pnpm versions match those in `package.json`.

```shell
pnpm install
```

Run the development server with the following command.

```shell
pnpm dev
```

The "App home" url is the dev Shopify Admin for this app. The "checkout ui extension" url is the dev store link for checkout ui extensions.

Refer to the [docs on testing extensions locally](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/checkout/best-practices/testing-ui-extensions#test-locally) if you are having trouble getting dynamic extension points to render.
